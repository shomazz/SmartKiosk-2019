# SmartKiosk
**Smart Kiosk Application**

An app designed to be installed on tablets in kiosks (user authentication is required to use the app).

**Description**

The user can scan a QR code, allowing the app to retrieve their data from the server. Based on this data, the app generates a PDF file for the userâ€™s badge and sends it to a local server that interacts with the printer. The printer then prints the generated file.
In this way, to print their badge, the user simply needs to scan the QR code they received via email when registering for the event.
